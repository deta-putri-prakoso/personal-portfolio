    "\n",
    "Before conducting an analysis using Python, we need to know what tools we can used to make our work easier. A Python librarty is a collection of functions and methods that allow us to perform lots of actions without writing any code. The libraries usually contain built in modules providing different functionalities which we can use directly. The Python data analysis libraries are divided into three groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Scientifics Computing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` :  used for data manipulation and analysis, access structured data (table consisting column and row) which are called data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` : uses arrays for its inputs and outputs, can be extended to matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scipy` : includes function for advanced math problem, as well as data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Visualization Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib` : makes graphs and plots, highly customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`seaborn` : generate various plots, such as heat maps, time series, and violin plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Machine Learning Algorithmic Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "`scikit-learn` : used for statistical modelling (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "To read any data using Python's `pandas` package, there are two important factors to consider: format and file path. One common encodings is CSV, or comma separated values. In `pandas` we can use `read_CSV` method to import the data, let us name it `df`. Take notes that it assumes the data contains a header. In addition, if we would like to save dataframe as a CSV-format file, we can use `df.to_csv(path)`."

    "\n",
    "After reading the dataset, we need to get better understanding about the data so we can get better intuition and ensure the data's quality. Check the source of the datasets and learn: what are the meaning of each attributes, what are all of the possible values in that attribute, and what is the data types. It is important to locate potential issues with the data before we begin any analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of data in Python are: object (string or characters), int64 (integer), float64 (decimals), and datetime64 (time data). Why check data types? First, to see potential info and type mismatch from the original table. Second, to ensure compatibility with python data science functions/methods.\n",

    "Here's some pandas function we can use to understand our data.\n",
    "- `df.head()` to show the first n rows of the data frame. \n",
    "- `df.column` to specify our table header (column names).\n",
    "- `df.dtypes` to check our data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical metrics can tell the data scientist if there are mathematical issues that may exist, such as outliers. To get the quick statistical summary, we use `df.describe()`. But, take notes that this functions skips missing value(s) that may contain in the data. To enable a summary of all the columns, we could add an argument: `df.describe(include=\"all\")`, which also include the object-type column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method we can use to check our dataset is the `df.info()` function. This function shows the top 30 rows and bottom 30 rows of the data frame."

    "\n",
    "What is missing value? It occurs when no data value is stord for a variable in an observation. It could be represented as \"?\", \"N/A\", \"NaN\", 0, or just a blank cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to deal with missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option 1: Check the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ask the person involved in the collecttion of the data if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option 2: Drop the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   By (1) drop the variable or (2) drop the data entry. To remove data that contains missing values, Panda's library has a built-in method called `df.dropna()`. Essentially, we can choose to drop the entire rows by adding arguments `axis=0`, or columns by `axis=1`. Setting the argument `inplace=True`, allows the modification to be done on the data set directly; or we can re-define the `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option 3: Replace the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This option seems to be a better option since there is no data is wasted. However, it is less accurate since we need to replace the missing data with a guess of what we think the data should be. Our guess is one of the chosen metrics: mean, modus, or based on other functions. Use `df.replace(missingvalue, newvalue)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that data value in each features are ranges differently, for example one attribute is in USD and the other is in meter. We may want to normalize these values so that the range is consistent. Normalization enables a fair comparison between the different features, making sure they have the same impact. It is also important for computational reasons.\n",

    "Several approaches for normalization:\n",

    "   \n",
    "3. Z-score or Standard score\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each value in the feature, subtract with its mean which is the average of the feature: `df[\"columnname\"].mean()`. Then, divide by the standard deviation: `df[\"columnname\"].std()`. The resulting values hover around zero, and typically range between negative three and positive three but can be higher or lower."
