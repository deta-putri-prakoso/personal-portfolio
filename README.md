This is my personal notebook to track my progress in the journey of becoming a data scientist. I am still learning thus I am open to any kind of feedback. Thank you.

# portfolio 1 - SQL
I took an online course on edx, called SQL for Data Science by IBM. The final assignment is to explore the data given (about the city of Chicago). 
I found the course fun and challenging, plus the course help me to sharpen my sense of understanding the data and what kind of insights I can get.
