# personal-portfolio
This is my personal notebook to track my progress in the journey of becoming a data scientist. I will keep uploading the notebook or report choronologically.
I am still learning thus I am open to any kind of feedback. Do not hesitate to reach out to me, as I will find your comments really helpful. Thank you!

# market basket anaylisis AND churn analysis
This report was made as my mid semester exam and final exam on Data Mining courses in my university, so they were in Bahasa Indonesia. On the first one, I did market basket analysis on google store using RStudio; and on the second report, I did clustering on customer data to predict customer churn. This time I used Python to conduct the analysis.
Back then (mid-year of 2019), I have no experience on data analysis, and any programming language at all. The syntax was already given by the lecturer so we were only need to change the data. But, I must say that this work that I did was not the best... BUT STILL, I found the course really fun and because of this course, I want to learn more about data analysis. So, I uploaded as a reminder / history / motivation for my future-self, despite of the not-so-great results.

# EDA using SQL
I took an online course on edx, called SQL for Data Science by IBM. In this course, I learn how to: composing and running basiq sql, using string and pattern, sorting and grouping results sets, working with multiple tables, and accessing databases using Python. The final assignment is to explore the data given (about the city of Chicago). 
I found the course fun and challenging, plus the course help me to sharpen my sense of understanding the data and what kind of insights I can get.

# Data pre-processing using Python
This time, I had a chance to enroll in Analyzing Data with Python courses by IBM. The learning objectives of this notebook is to importing the datasets, data formatting, data normalization, binning, including how to identify and handle missing values.
